Before you execute these installation steps, check you have the next package in your system:
- openssl development
- postgresql
- postgresql development (postgresql-server-dev)
Otherwise, install them.

Instructions:
- Download MIRACL zip package (https://github.com/CertiVox/MIRACL)
- Unzip the package in a new directory (e.g. "miracl") without keeping directory structure (unzip -j -aa -L miracl.zip)
- From the MIRACL directory run "bash linux" command
- Install MIRACL (official guide http://docs.miracl.com/docs/miracl/miracl-users-manual/installation). The following are the steps for my Intel Core i5 Linux 64-bit configuration, you may need to change something for different configurations:
	- run "gcc config.c -o config"
	- run "./config" and follow the answers given in "miracl_config_options"
	- rename the generated file "mirdef.tst" to "mirdef.h"
	- rename "mrmuldv.g64" to "mrmuldv.c"
	- run "gcc -I. -fpic -c -O2 mr*.c"
	- run "ar rc miracl.a mr*.o"
- copy and paste "miracl.patch" in MIRACL folder
- run "patch < miracl.patch"
- copy and paste all the elements from the project directory to the miracl one
- run "make" command
- 

If you have any problem, check the Makefile to be sure that the postgresql library path is correct.
The system was implemented and tested using both postgresql and postgresql development version 9.3.

Look at "READEME.md" to know how to use the wrapper.
